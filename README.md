# Crowdfunding Platform Contract

This contract implements a basic crowdfunding platform where users can create projects with funding targets and deadlines. Other users can contribute to these projects.

## Features

- Users can create crowdfunding projects with a target amount and a deadline.
- Users can contribute to active projects.
- Project owners can withdraw funds if the target amount is reached after the deadline.

## How to Use

1. Deploy the contract.
2. Use the `createProject()` function to create a new crowdfunding project.
3. Other users can contribute to the project using `contribute()`.
4. After the deadline, if the target amount is reached, the project owner can withdraw funds using `withdrawFunds()`.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the project owner is trustworthy, as they can withdraw the funds after the target is met.
- Contributions cannot be refunded unless explicitly coded, so contributors should be careful before investing.
